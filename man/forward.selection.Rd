\usage{
forward.selection(x, y, init.model, family, choose.from = NULL,
  test = c("t", "wilcoxon"), sel.crit = c("paired.test", "total.loglik",
  "both"), num.filter = 0, filter.ignore = NULL, num.inner.folds = 30,
  max.iters = 15, max.pval = 0.5, min.llk.diff = 0, seed = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Dataframe of predictors: this should include all variables in
the initial set and the variables that are allowed to enter the
selected panel.}

\item{y}{Outcome variable. If \code{family=binomial}, it can only contain
two classes of values that can be coerced to 0-1.}

\item{init.model}{Either a formula or a vector of names of the initial set
of variables that define the model from which the forward selection
should start.}

\item{family}{Type of model fitted: either \code{gaussian()} for linear
regression or \code{binomial()} for logistic regression. This can be
specified also as a function name (\code{gaussian}) or as a string
(\code{"gaussian"}).}

\item{choose.from}{Indices or variable names over which the selection should
be performed. If \code{NULL} (default), all variables in \code{x}
that are not in \code{init.model} are considered.}

\item{test}{Type of statistical paired test to use (ignored if
\code{sel.crit="total.loglik"}).}

\item{sel.crit}{Selection criterion: \code{"paired.test"} chooses the
variable with best p-value on the paired test indicated by
\code{test}; \code{"total.loglik"} chooses the variable that provides
the largest increase in log-likelihood; \code{"both"} attempts to
combine both previous criteria, choosing the variable that produces
the largest increase in log-likelihood only among the best 5
variables ranked according to the paired-test p-value.}

\item{num.filter}{Number of variables to be retained by the univariate
association filter (see \strong{Details}), which can only be enabled
if \code{family=binomial()}. Variables listed in \code{init.model}
are never filtered. If set to 0 (default), the filter is disabled.}

\item{filter.ignore}{Vector of variable names that should not be pruned by
the univariate association filter so that they are always allowed to
be selected (ignored if \code{num.filter=0}).}

\item{num.inner.folds}{Number of folds in the inner cross-validation. It
must be at least 5 (default: 30).}

\item{max.iters}{Maximum number of iterations (default: 15).}

\item{max.pval}{Interrupt the selection when the best achievable p-value
exceeds this threshold (default: 0.5).}

\item{min.llk.diff}{Interrupt the selection when the best achievable
improvement in log-likelihood is smaller than this threshold
(default: 0).}

\item{seed}{Seed of the random number generator for the inner folds.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{fs} containing the following fields:
\describe{
\item{fs:}{A dataframe containing the forward selection summary.}
\item{init:}{The set of variables used in the initial model.}
\item{panel:}{ Names of variables selected (in order).}
\item{init.model:}{Right-hand side of the formula corresponding to the
      initial model.}
\item{final.model:}{Right-hand side of the formula corresponding to the
      final model.}
\item{family:}{Type of model fitted.}
\item{params:}{List of parameters used.}
\item{iter1:}{Summary statistics for all variables at the first iteration.}
\item{all.iter:}{Validation log-likelihoods for all inner folds at all
      iterations.}
}
}
\description{
Run forward selection starting from a set of variables or a model.
}
\details{
At each iteration, this function runs cross-validation to choose which
variable enters the final panel by fitting the current model (defined in
\code{init.model} as a list of variables or a formula for the first
iteration) augmented by one of the remaining variables at a time.

This function is used to choose a panel of variables on the data. As it uses
all observations in the \code{x} dataframe, it is not possible to
produce unbiased estimates of the predictive performance of the panel
selected (use \code{\link{nested.forward.selection}} for that purpose).

In the case of a binary outcome when very large number of predictors is
available, it may be convenient to apply a univariate association filter.
If \code{num.filter} is set to a positive value, then all available
predictors (excluding those whose name is matched by \code{filter.ignore})
are tested for univariate association with the outcome, and only the first
\code{num.filter} enter the selection phase, while the others are filtered
out. This is done on the training part of all inner folds. Filtering can
enhance the performance of forward selection when the number of available
variables exceeds about 30-40.
